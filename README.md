# Multi-Layer-Perceptron-on-MNIST-Dataset
This report implemented a Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP) model using the PyTorch library to classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset consists of 28x28 pixel grayscale images, each representing a digit from 0 to 9, with 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images.
